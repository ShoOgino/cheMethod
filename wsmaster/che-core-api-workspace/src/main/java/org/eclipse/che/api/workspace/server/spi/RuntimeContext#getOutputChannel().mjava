   * <ul>
   *   <li>this endpoint is open and ready to use
   *   <li>this endpoint emits only messages of specified formats (TODO specify the formats)
   *   <li>high loaded infrastructure provides scaling of "messaging server" to avoid overloading

   * @throws InfrastructureException when any other error occurs
