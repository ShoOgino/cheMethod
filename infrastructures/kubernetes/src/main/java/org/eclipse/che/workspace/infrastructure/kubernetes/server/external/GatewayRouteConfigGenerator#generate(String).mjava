   * Generates content of configurations for services, defined earlier by added {@link

   * Gateway pod.
   *
   * <p>Implementation must ensure that Gateway configured with returned content will route the
   * requests on {@code path} into {@code serviceUrl}. Also it must strip {@code path} from request
   * url.
   *
   * <p>Returned Map's Keys will be used as file names, Values as their content. e.g.:
   *
   * <pre>
   *   service1.yml: {config-content-for-service-1}
   *   service2.yml: {config-content-for-service-2}
   * </pre>
   *
   * @return full content of configuration for the services
