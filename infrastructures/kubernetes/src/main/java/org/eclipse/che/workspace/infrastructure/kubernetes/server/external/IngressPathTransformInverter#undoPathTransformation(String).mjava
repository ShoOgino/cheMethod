   * single-host strategy where the path needs to contain a regular expression match group to retain
   * some of the path (at least in the case of the nginx ingress controller).
   *
   * <p>This method reverts such mangling and returns to the user a path that can be used by the
   * HTTP clients.
   *
   * @param path the path contained within the configuration of the object that needs to be
   *     demangled
   * @return the path demangled such that it can be used in an externally reachable URL or the
   *     untouched path if the path doesn't match the configured path format.
