    /**
     * Reset current HEAD to the specified state. There two types of the reset: <br>
     * 1. Reset files in index - content of files is untouched. Typically it is useful to remove from index mistakenly added files.<br>
     * <code>git reset [paths]</code> is the opposite of <code>git add [paths]</code>. 2. Reset the current branch head to [commit] and
     * possibly updates the index (resetting it to the tree of [commit]) and the working tree depending on [mode].
     *
     * @param devMachine
     *         current machine
     * @param project
     *         project (root of GIT repository)
     * @param commit
     *         commit to which current head should be reset
     * @param resetType
     *         type of the reset
     * @param filePattern
     *         pattern of the files to reset the index. If <code>null</code> then reset the current branch head to [commit],
     *         else reset received files in index.
     * @deprecated use {@link #reset(DevMachine, Path, String, ResetRequest.ResetType, Path[])}
