  /**
   * Returns flags which describe in more detail how a resource has been affected.
   *
   * <p>The following codes (bit masks) are used when kind is {@code UPDATED}, and also when the
   * resource is involved in a move:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>{@code CONTENT} - The bytes contained by the resource have been altered, or <code>
   *       IResource.touch</code> has been called on the resource.
   *   <li>{@code MOVED_FROM} - The resource has moved. {@link #getFromPath()} will return the path
   *       of where it was moved from.
   *   <li>{@code MOVED_TO} - The resource has moved. {@link #getToPath()} ()} will return the path
   *       of where it was moved to.
   *   <li>{@code COPIED_FROM} - Change constant (bit mask) indicating that the resource was copied
   *       from another location. The location can be retrieved using {@link #getFromPath()}.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>A simple move operation would result in the following delta information. If a resource is
   * moved from A to B (with no other changes to A or B), then A will have kind {@code REMOVED},
   * with flag {@code MOVED_TO}, and {@link #getToPath()} on A will return the path for B. B will
   * have kind {@code ADDED}, with flag {@code MOVED_FROM}, and {@link #getFromPath()} on B will
   * return the path for A.
