     * Copies resource to given {@code destination} path. Copy operation performs asynchronously and result of current
     * operation will be provided in {@code Promise} result. Destination path should have write access.
     * <p/>
     * Copy operation produces new {@link Resource} which is already cached.
     * <p/>
     * Fires following events:
     * {@link ResourceChangedEvent} when resource has successfully copied. This event provides information about copied
     * resource and source resource.
     * <p/>
     * Passing {@code force} argument as true method will ignore existed resource on the server and overwrite them.
     * <p/>
     * Example of usage:
     * <pre>
     *     Resource resource = ... ;
     *     Path copyTo = ... ;
     *
     *     resource.copy(copyTo, true).then(new Operation<Resource>() {
     *          public void apply(Resource copiedResource) throws OperationException {
     *              //do something with copiedResource
     *          }
     *     })
     * </pre>
     * <p/>
     * Fires {@link ResourceChangedEvent} with the following {@link ResourceDelta}:
     * Delta kind: {@link ResourceDelta#ADDED}.
     * Copied resource provided by {@link ResourceDelta#getResource()}.
     * Contains flags {@link ResourceDelta#COPIED_FROM}.
     * Source resource is accessible by calling {@link ResourceDelta#getFromPath()}.
     *
     * @param destination
     *         the destination path
     * @param force
     *         overwrite existed resource on the server
     * @return {@link Promise} with copied {@link Resource}
     * @throws IllegalStateException
     *         if this resource could not be copied. Reasons include:

     *         <li>Resource already exists</li>
     *         <li>Resource with path '/path' isn't a project</li>
