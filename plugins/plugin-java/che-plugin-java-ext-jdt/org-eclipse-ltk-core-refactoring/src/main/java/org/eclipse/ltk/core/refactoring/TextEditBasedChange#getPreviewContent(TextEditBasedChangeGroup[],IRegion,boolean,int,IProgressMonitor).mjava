  /**
   * Returns a preview of the text edit change clipped to a specific region. The preview is created
   * by applying the text edits managed by the given array of {@link TextEditBasedChangeGroup text
   * edit change groups}. The region is determined as follows:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>if <code>expandRegionToFullLine</code> is <code>false</code> then the parameter <code>
   *       region</code> determines the clipping.
   *   <li>if <code>expandRegionToFullLine</code> is <code>true</code> then the region determined by
   *       the parameter <code>region</code> is extended to cover full lines.
   *   <li>if <code>surroundingLines</code> &gt; 0 then the given number of surrounding lines is
   *       added. The value of <code>surroundingLines
   *       </code> is only considered if <code>expandRegionToFullLine</code> is <code>true</code>
   * </ul>
   *
   * @param changeGroups a set of change groups for which a preview is to be generated
   * @param region the starting region for the clipping
   * @param expandRegionToFullLine if <code>true</code> is passed the region is extended to cover
   *     full lines
   * @param surroundingLines the number of surrounding lines to be added to the clipping region. Is
   *     only considered if <code>expandRegionToFullLine
   *  </code> is <code>true</code>
   * @param pm a progress monitor to report progress or <code>null</code> if no progress reporting
   *     is desired
   * @return the current content of the text change clipped to a region determined by the given
   *     parameters.
   * @throws CoreException if an exception occurs while generating the preview
   * @see #getCurrentContent(IRegion, boolean, int, IProgressMonitor)
