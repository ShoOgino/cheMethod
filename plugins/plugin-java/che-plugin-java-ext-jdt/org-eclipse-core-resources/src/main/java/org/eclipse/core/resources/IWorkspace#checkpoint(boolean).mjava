	/**
	 * Checkpoints the operation currently in progress. This method is used in
	 * the middle of a group of operations to force a background autobuild (if
	 * the build argument is true) and send an interim notification of resource
	 * change events.
	 * <p>
	 * When invoked in the dynamic scope of a call to the
	 * <code>IWorkspace.run</code> method, this method reports a single
	 * resource change event describing the net effect of all changes done to
	 * resources since the last round of notifications. When the outermost
	 * <code>run</code> method eventually completes, it will do another
	 * autobuild (if enabled) and report the resource changes made after this
	 * call.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * This method has no effect if invoked outside the dynamic scope of a call
	 * to the <code>IWorkspace.run</code> method.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * This method should be used under controlled circumstance (e.g., to break
	 * up extremely long-running operations).
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * @param build whether or not to run a build
	 * @see IWorkspace#run(IWorkspaceRunnable, ISchedulingRule, int, IProgressMonitor)
