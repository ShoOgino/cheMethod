	/**
	 * Validates the given path as the location of the given resource on disk.
	 * The path must be either an absolute file system path, or a relative path
	 * whose first segment is the name of a defined workspace path variable. In
	 * addition to the restrictions for paths in general (see <code>IPath.
	 * isValidPath</code>),
	 * a link location must also obey the following rules:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>must not overlap with the platform's metadata directory</li>
	 * <li>must not be the same as or a parent of the root directory of the
	 * project the linked resource is contained in</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * <p>
	 * This method also checks that the given resource can legally become a
	 * linked resource. This includes the following restrictions:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>must have a project as its immediate parent</li>
	 * <li>project natures and the team hook may disallow linked resources on
	 * projects they are associated with</li>
	 * <li>the global workspace preference to disable linking,
	 * <code>ResourcesPlugin.PREF_DISABLE_LINKING</code> must not be set to
	 * &quot;true&quot;</li>.
	 * </ul>
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * This method will return a status with severity <code>IStatus.FAILED</code>
	 * if the location does not obey the above rules. Also, this method will
	 * return a status with severity <code>IStatus.WARNING</code> if the
	 * location overlaps the location of any existing resource in the workspace.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Note: this method does not consider whether files or directories exist in
	 * the file system at the specified path.
	 * 
	 * @param resource the resource to validate the location for
	 * @param location the location of the linked resource contents on disk
	 * @return a status object with code <code>IStatus.OK</code> if the given
	 * location is valid as the linked resource location, otherwise a status
	 * object with severity <code>IStatus.WARNING</code> or
	 * <code>IStatus.FAILED</code> indicating what is wrong with the location
	 * @see IStatus#OK
	 * @see ResourcesPlugin#PREF_DISABLE_LINKING
