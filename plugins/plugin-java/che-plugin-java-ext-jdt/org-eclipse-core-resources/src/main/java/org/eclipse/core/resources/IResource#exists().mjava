	 * Returns whether this resource exists in the workspace.
	 * <p>
	 * <code>IResource</code> objects are lightweight handle objects
	 * used to access resources in the workspace. However, having a
	 * handle object does not necessarily mean the workspace really 
	 * has such a resource. When the workspace does have a genuine
	 * resource of a matching type, the resource is said to 
	 * <em>exist</em>, and this method returns <code>true</code>; 
	 * in all other cases, this method returns <code>false</code>.
	 * In particular, it returns <code>false</code> if the workspace
	 * has no resource at that path, or if it has a resource at that
	 * path with a type different from the type of this resource handle.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Note that no resources ever exist under a project 
	 * that is closed; opening a project may bring some
	 * resources into existence.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The name and path of a resource handle may be invalid.
	 * However, validation checks are done automatically as a 
	 * resource is created; this means that any resource that exists
	 * can be safely assumed to have a valid name and path.
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * @return <code>true</code> if the resource exists, otherwise
	 *    <code>false</code>
