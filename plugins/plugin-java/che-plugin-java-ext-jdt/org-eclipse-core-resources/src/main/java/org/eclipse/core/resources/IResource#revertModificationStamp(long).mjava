	/**
	 * Reverts this resource's modification stamp.  This is intended to be used by 
	 * a client that is rolling back or undoing a previous change to this resource.  
	 * <p>
	 * It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that the value of the reverted 
	 * modification stamp matches this resource's modification stamp prior to the 
	 * change that has been rolled back.  More generally, the caller must ensure
	 * that the specification of modification stamps outlined in 
	 * <code>getModificationStamp</code> is honored; the modification stamp
	 * of two distinct resource states should be different if and only if one or more
	 * of the attributes listed in the specification as affecting the modification
	 * stamp have changed.
	 * <p>
	 * Reverting the modification stamp will <b>not</b> be reported in a 
	 * subsequent resource change event.
	 * <p>
	 * Note that a resource's modification stamp is unrelated to the local
	 * time stamp for this resource on disk, if any.  A resource's local time
	 * stamp is modified using the <code>setLocalTimeStamp</code> method.
	 * 
	 * @param value A non-negative modification stamp value
	 * @exception CoreException if this method fails. Reasons include:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li> This resource does not exist.</li>
	 * <li> This resource is not local.</li>
	 * <li> This resource is not accessible.</li>
	 * <li> Resource changes are disallowed during certain types of resource change 
	 *       event notification. See <code>IResourceChangeEvent</code> for more details.</li>
