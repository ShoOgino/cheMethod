  /**
   * Returns the members of the base resource corresponding to the given container. The container
   * and the returned members need not exist locally and may not include all children that exist
   * locally. An empty list is returned if the base resource is empty or does not exist. An
   * exception is thrown if the base resource is not capable of having members. This method returns
   * <code>null</code> if the base members cannot be computed, in which case clients should call
   * {@link #fetchMembers( IContainer , IProgressMonitor)} which returns the combined members for
   * the base and remote.
   *
   * <p>This method may be long running as a server may need to be contacted to obtain the members
   * of the base resource.
   *
   * <p>This default implementation always returns <code>null</code>, but subclasses may override.
   *
   * @param container the local container
   * @param monitor a progress monitor, or <code>null</code> if progress reporting is not desired
   * @return the members of the base resource corresponding to the given container
   * @exception CoreException if the members could not be fetched. Reasons include:
   *     <ul>
   *       <li>The server could not be contacted for some reason.
   *       <li>The base resource is not a container (status code will be {@link
   *           IResourceStatus#RESOURCE_WRONG_TYPE}).
   *     </ul>
