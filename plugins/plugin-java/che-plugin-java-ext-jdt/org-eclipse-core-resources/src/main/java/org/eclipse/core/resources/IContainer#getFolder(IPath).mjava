   * is constructed; rather, it is done automatically as the resource is created.
   *
   * <p>The supplied path may be absolute or relative; in either case, it is interpreted as relative
   * to this resource and is appended to this container's full path to form the full path of the
   * resultant resource. A trailing separator is ignored. The path of the resulting resource must
   * have at least two segments.

   * @return the (handle of the) member folder
