  /**
   * Returns flags which describe in more detail how a resource has been affected.
   *
   * <p>The following codes (bit masks) are used when kind is <code>CHANGED</code>, and also when
   * the resource is involved in a move:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li><code>CONTENT</code> - The bytes contained by the resource have been altered, or <code>
   *       IResource.touch</code> has been called on the resource.
   *   <li><code>DERIVED_CHANGED</code> - The derived flag of the resource has been altered.
   *   <li><code>ENCODING</code> - The encoding of the resource may have been altered. This flag is
   *       not set when the encoding changes due to the file being modified, or being moved.
   *   <li><code>DESCRIPTION</code> - The description of the project has been altered, or <code>
   *       IResource.touch</code> has been called on the project. This flag is only valid for
   *       project resources.
   *   <li><code>OPEN</code> - The project's open/closed state has changed. If it is not open, it
   *       was closed, and vice versa. This flag is only valid for project resources.
   *   <li><code>TYPE</code> - The resource (a folder or file) has changed its type.
   *   <li><code>SYNC</code> - The resource's sync status has changed.
   *   <li><code>MARKERS</code> - The resource's markers have changed.
   *   <li><code>REPLACED</code> - The resource (and all its properties) was deleted (either by a
   *       delete or move), and was subsequently re-created (either by a create, move, or copy).
   *   <li><code>LOCAL_CHANGED</code> - The resource is a linked resource, and the underlying file
   *       system object has been added or removed.
   * </ul>
   *
   * The following code is only used if kind is <code>REMOVED</code> (or <code>CHANGED</code> in
   * conjunction with <code>REPLACED</code>):
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li><code>MOVED_TO</code> - The resource has moved. <code>getMovedToPath</code> will return
   *       the path of where it was moved to.
   * </ul>
   *
   * The following code is only used if kind is <code>ADDED</code> (or <code>CHANGED</code> in
   * conjunction with <code>REPLACED</code>):
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li><code>MOVED_FROM</code> - The resource has moved. <code>getMovedFromPath</code> will
   *       return the path of where it was moved from.
   * </ul>
   *
   * The following code is only used when describing potential changes using an {@link
   * IResourceChangeDescriptionFactory}:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li><code>COPIED_FROM</code> - Change constant (bit mask) indicating that the resource was
   *       copied from another location. The location in the "before" state can be retrieved using
   *       <code>getMovedFromPath()</code>.
   * </ul>
   *
   * A simple move operation would result in the following delta information. If a resource is moved
   * from A to B (with no other changes to A or B), then A will have kind <code>REMOVED</code>, with
   * flag <code>MOVED_TO</code>, and <code>getMovedToPath</code> on A will return the path for B. B
   * will have kind <code>ADDED</code>, with flag <code>MOVED_FROM</code>, and <code>
   * getMovedFromPath</code> on B will return the path for A. B's other flags will describe any
   * other changes to the resource, as compared to its previous location at A.
   *
   * <p>Note that the move flags only describe the changes to a single resource; they don't
   * necessarily imply anything about the parent or children of the resource. If the children were
   * moved as a consequence of a subtree move operation, they will have corresponding move flags as
   * well.
   *
   * <p>Note that it is possible for a file resource to be replaced in the workspace by a folder
   * resource (or the other way around). The resource delta, which is actually expressed in terms of
   * paths instead or resources, shows this as a change to either the content or children.
