	 * Indicates that the saved workspace tree should be remembered so that a delta
	 * will be available in a subsequent session when the plug-in re-registers
	 * to participate in saves. If this method is not called, no resource delta will 
	 * be made available. This facility is not available for marker deltas.
	 * Plug-ins must assume that all markers may have changed when they are activated.
	 * <p>
	 * Note that this is orthogonal to <code>needSaveNumber</code>. That is,
	 * one can ask for a delta regardless of whether or not one is an active participant.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Note that deltas are not guaranteed to be saved even if saving is requested.
	 * Deltas cannot be supplied where the previous state is too old or has become invalid.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * This method is only valid for full saves. It is ignored during snapshots
	 * or project saves.
