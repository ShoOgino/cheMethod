	 * Renames or relocates this project so that it is the project specified by the given project 
	 * description.
	 * <p>
	 * This is a convenience method, fully equivalent to:
	 * <pre>
	 *   move(description, (keepHistory ? KEEP_HISTORY : IResource.NONE) | (force ? FORCE : IResource.NONE), monitor);
	 * </pre>
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * This operation changes resources; these changes will be reported
	 * in a subsequent resource change event that will include 
	 * an indication that the resource has been removed from its parent
	 * and that a corresponding resource has been added to its new parent.
	 * Additional information provided with resource delta shows that these
	 * additions and removals are related.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * This method is long-running; progress and cancellation are provided
	 * by the given progress monitor. 
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * @param description the destination project description
	 * @param force a flag controlling whether resources that are not
	 *    in sync with the local file system will be tolerated
	 * @param keepHistory a flag indicating whether or not to keep
	 *    local history for files
	 * @param monitor a progress monitor, or <code>null</code> if progress
	 *    reporting is not desired
	 * @exception CoreException if this resource could not be moved. Reasons include:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li> This resource does not exist.</li>
	 * <li> This resource or one of its descendents is not local.</li>
	 * <li> This resource is not a project.</li>
	 * <li> The project at the destination already exists.</li>
	 * <li> This resource or one of its descendents is out of sync with the local file
	 *      system and <code>force</code> is <code>false</code>.</li>
	 * <li> The workspace and the local file system are out of sync
	 *      at the destination resource or one of its descendents.</li>
	 * <li> Resource changes are disallowed during certain types of resource change 
	 *       event notification. See <code>IResourceChangeEvent</code> for more details.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * @exception OperationCanceledException if the operation is canceled. 
	 * Cancelation can occur even if no progress monitor is provided.
	 * @see IResourceDelta#getFlags()
