   * Changes this project resource to match the given project description. This project should exist

   * <p>This is a convenience method, fully equivalent to:
   *
   * <pre>
   *   setDescription(description, KEEP_HISTORY, monitor);
   * </pre>
   *
   * <p>This method requires the {@link IWorkspaceRoot} scheduling rule.
   *
   * <p>This method changes resources; these changes will be reported in a subsequent resource
   * change event, including an indication that the project's content has changed.
   *
   * <p>This method is long-running; progress and cancellation are provided by the given progress
   * monitor.
   *
   * @param description the project description
   * @param monitor a progress monitor, or <code>null</code> if progress reporting is not desired
   * @exception CoreException if this method fails. Reasons include:
   *     <ul>
   *       <li>This project does not exist in the workspace.
   *       <li>This project is not open.
   *       <li>The location in the local file system corresponding to the project description file
   *           is occupied by a directory.
   *       <li>The workspace is out of sync with the project description file in the local file
   *           system .
   *       <li>Resource changes are disallowed during certain types of resource change event
   *           notification. See <code>IResourceChangeEvent</code> for more details.
   *       <li>The file modification validator disallowed the change.
   *     </ul>
   *
   * @exception OperationCanceledException if the operation is canceled. Cancelation can occur even
   *     if no progress monitor is provided.
