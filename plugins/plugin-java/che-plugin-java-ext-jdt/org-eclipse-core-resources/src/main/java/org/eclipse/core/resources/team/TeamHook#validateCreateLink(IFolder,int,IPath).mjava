	 * Validates whether a particular attempt at link creation is allowed.  This gives
	 * team providers an opportunity to hook into the beginning of the implementation
	 * of <code>IFolder.createLink</code>.
	 * <p>
	 * The implementation of this method runs "below" the resources API and is
	 * therefore very restricted in what resource API method it can call. The
	 * list of useable methods includes most resource operations that read but
	 * do not update the resource tree; resource operations that modify
	 * resources and trigger deltas must not be called from within the dynamic
	 * scope of the invocation of this method.
	 * </p><p>
	 * This method should be overridden by subclasses that want to control what
	 * links are created.  The default implementation of this method allows all links
	 * to be created.
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * @param folder the file to be linked
	 * @param updateFlags bit-wise or of update flag constants
	 *   (only ALLOW_MISSING_LOCAL is relevant here)
	 * @param location a file system path where the folder should be linked
	 * @return a status object with code <code>IStatus.OK</code>
	 * 	if linking is allowed, otherwise a status object with severity
	 * 	<code>IStatus.FAILED</code> indicating why the creation is not allowed.
	 * @see org.eclipse.core.resources.IResource#ALLOW_MISSING_LOCAL
