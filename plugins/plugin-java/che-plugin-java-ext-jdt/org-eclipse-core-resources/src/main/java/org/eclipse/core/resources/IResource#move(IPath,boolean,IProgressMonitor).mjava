	/**
	 * Moves this resource so that it is located at the given path.  
	 * <p>
	 * This is a convenience method, fully equivalent to:
	 * <pre>
	 *   move(destination, force ? FORCE : IResource.NONE, monitor);
	 * </pre>
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * This method changes resources; these changes will be reported
	 * in a subsequent resource change event that will include 
	 * an indication that the resource has been removed from its parent
	 * and that a corresponding resource has been added to its new parent.
	 * Additional information provided with resource delta shows that these
	 * additions and removals are related.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * This method is long-running; progress and cancellation are provided
	 * by the given progress monitor. 
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * @param destination the destination path 
	 * @param force a flag controlling whether resources that are not
	 *    in sync with the local file system will be tolerated
	 * @param monitor a progress monitor, or <code>null</code> if progress
	 *    reporting is not desired
	 * @exception CoreException if this resource could not be moved. Reasons include:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li> This resource does not exist.</li>
	 * <li> This resource or one of its descendents is not local.</li>
	 * <li> The source or destination is the workspace root.</li>
	 * <li> The source is a project but the destination is not.</li>
	 * <li> The destination is a project but the source is not.</li>
	 * <li> The resource corresponding to the parent destination path does not exist.</li>
	 * <li> The resource corresponding to the parent destination path is a closed 
	 *      project.</li>
	 * <li> A resource at destination path does exist.</li>
	 * <li> A resource of a different type exists at the destination path.</li>
	 * <li> This resource or one of its descendents is out of sync with the local file
	 *      system and <code>force</code> is <code>false</code>.</li>
	 * <li> The workspace and the local file system are out of sync
	 *      at the destination resource or one of its descendents.</li>
	 * <li> Resource changes are disallowed during certain types of resource change 
	 *       event notification. See <code>IResourceChangeEvent</code> for more details.</li>
	 * <li> The source resource is a file and the destination path specifies a project.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * @exception OperationCanceledException if the operation is canceled. 
	 * Cancelation can occur even if no progress monitor is provided.
	 * @see IResourceDelta#getFlags()
