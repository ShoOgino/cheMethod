	/**
	 * Returns a handle for the affected resource.
	 * <p> 
	 * For additions (<code>ADDED</code>), this handle describes the newly-added resource; i.e.,
	 * the one in the "after" state.
	 * <p> 
	 * For changes (<code>CHANGED</code>), this handle also describes the resource in the "after"
	 * state. When a file or folder resource has changed type, the
	 * former type of the handle can be inferred.
	 * <p>
	 * For removals (<code>REMOVED</code>), this handle describes the resource in the "before" 
	 * state. Even though this resource would not normally exist in the
	 * current workspace, the type of resource that was removed can be
	 * determined from the handle.
	 * <p> 
	 * For phantom additions and removals (<code>ADDED_PHANTOM</code>
	 * and <code>REMOVED_PHANTOM</code>), this is the handle of the phantom resource.
	 *
	 * @return the affected resource (handle)
