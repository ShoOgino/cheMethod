  /**
   * Returns the full, absolute path of this resource relative to the workspace.
   *
   * <p>This is a resource handle operation; the resource need not exist. If this resource does
   * exist, its path can be safely assumed to be valid.
   *
   * <p>A resource's full path indicates the route from the root of the workspace to the resource.
   * Within a workspace, there is exactly one such path for any given resource. The first segment of
   * these paths name a project; remaining segments, folders and/or files within that project. The
   * returned path never has a trailing separator. The path of the workspace root is <code>Path.ROOT
   * </code>.
   *
   * <p>Since absolute paths contain the name of the project, they are vulnerable when the project
   * is renamed. For most situations, project-relative paths are recommended over absolute paths.
   *
   * @return the absolute path of this resource
   * @see #getProjectRelativePath()
   * @see Path#ROOT
