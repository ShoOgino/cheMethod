	 * Finds and returns the descendent delta identified by the given path in
	 * this delta, or <code>null</code> if no such descendent exists.
	 * The supplied path may be absolute or relative; in either case, it is
	 * interpreted as relative to this delta.   Trailing separators are ignored.
	 * If the path is empty this delta is returned.
	 * <p>
	 * This is a convenience method to avoid manual traversal of the delta
	 * tree in cases where the listener is only interested in changes to
	 * particular resources.  Calling this method will generally be
	 * faster than manually traversing the delta to a particular descendent.
