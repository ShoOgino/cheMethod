  /**
   * Returns resource deltas for all children of this resource whose kind is included in the given
   * mask. Masks are formed by the bitwise or of <code>IResourceDelta</code> kind constants. Returns
   * an empty array if there are no affected children.
   *
   * <p>If the <code>INCLUDE_TEAM_PRIVATE_MEMBERS</code> member flag is not specified,
   * (recommended), resource deltas involving team private member resources will be excluded. If the
   * <code>INCLUDE_TEAM_PRIVATE_MEMBERS</code> member flag is specified, the result will also
   * include resource deltas of the specified kinds to team private member resources.
   *
   * <p>If the {@link IContainer#INCLUDE_HIDDEN} member flag is not specified, (recommended),
   * resource deltas involving hidden resources will be excluded. If the {@link
   * IContainer#INCLUDE_HIDDEN} member flag is specified, the result will also include resource
   * deltas of the specified kinds to hidden resources.
   *
   * <p>Specifying the <code>IContainer.INCLUDE_PHANTOMS</code> member flag is equivalent to
   * including <code>IContainer.ADDED_PHANTOM</code> and <code>IContainer.REMOVED_PHANTOM</code> in
   * the kind mask.
