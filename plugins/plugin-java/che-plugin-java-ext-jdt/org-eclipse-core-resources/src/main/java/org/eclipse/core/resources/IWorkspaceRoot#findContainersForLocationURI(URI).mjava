  /**
   * Returns the handles to all the resources (workspace root, project, folder) in the workspace
   * which are mapped to the given URI. Returns an empty array if there are none.
   *
   * <p>If the path maps to the platform working location, the returned object will be a single
   * element array consisting of an object of type <code>ROOT</code>.
   *
   * <p>If the path maps to a project, the resulting array will contain a resource of type <code>
   * PROJECT</code>, along with any linked folders that share the same location. Otherwise the
   * resulting array will contain folders (type <code>FOLDER</code>).
   *
   * <p>The URI must be absolute; its segments need not be valid names; a trailing separator is
   * ignored. The resulting resources may not currently exist.
   *
   * <p>The result will omit team private members and hidden resources. The result will omit
   * resources within team private member sor hidden containers.
   *
   * <p>The result will also omit resources that are explicitly excluded from the workspace
   * according to existing resource filters.
   *
   * <p>This is a convenience method, fully equivalent to <code>
   * findContainersForLocationURI(location, IResource.NONE)</code>.
   *
   * @param location a URI path into some file system
   * @return the corresponding containers in the workspace, or an empty array if none
   * @since 3.2
