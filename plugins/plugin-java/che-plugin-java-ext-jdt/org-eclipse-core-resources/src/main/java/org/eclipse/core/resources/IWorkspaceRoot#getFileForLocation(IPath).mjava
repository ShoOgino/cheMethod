	 * Returns a handle to the file which is mapped to the given path 
	 * in the local file system, or <code>null</code> if none.
	 * The path should be absolute; a relative path will be treated as
	 * absolute.  The path segments need not be valid names.
	 * The resulting file may not currently exist.
	 * <p>
	 * This method returns null when the given file system location is not under
	 * the location of any existing project in the workspace.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The result will also omit resources that are explicitly excluded 
	 * from the workspace according to existing resource filters.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Warning: This method ignores linked resources and their children.  Since
	 * linked resources may overlap other resources, a unique mapping from a
	 * file system location to a single resource is not guaranteed.  To find all 
	 * resources for a given location, including linked resources, use the method
	 * <code>findFilesForLocation</code>.
