  /**
   * Resolves a relative <code>URI</code> object potentially containing a variable reference as its

   * then no variable substitution is done and that URI is returned as is. If the given URI is
   * relative and has a <code>null</code> device, but the first segment does not correspond to a
   * defined variable, then the URI is returned as is.
   *
   * <p>If the given URI is <code>null</code> then <code>null</code> will be returned. In all other
   * cases the result will be non-<code>null</code>.

   * @param uri the URI to be resolved
