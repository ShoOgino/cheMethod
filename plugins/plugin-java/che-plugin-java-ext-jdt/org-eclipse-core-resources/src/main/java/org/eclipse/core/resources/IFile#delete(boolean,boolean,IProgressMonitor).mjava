	/**
	 * Deletes this file from the workspace.
	 * <p>
	 * This is a convenience method, fully equivalent to:
	 * <pre>
	 *   delete((keepHistory ? KEEP_HISTORY : IResource.NONE) | (force ? FORCE : IResource.NONE), monitor);
	 * </pre>
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * This method changes resources; these changes will be reported
	 * in a subsequent resource change event, including an indication 
	 * that this folder has been removed from its parent.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * This method is long-running; progress and cancellation are provided
	 * by the given progress monitor. 
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * @param force a flag controlling whether resources that are not
	 *    in sync with the local file system will be tolerated
	 * @param keepHistory a flag controlling whether files under this folder
	 *    should be stored in the workspace's local history
	 * @param monitor a progress monitor, or <code>null</code> if progress
	 *    reporting is not desired
	 * @exception CoreException if this method fails. Reasons include:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li> This resource could not be deleted for some reason.</li>
	 * <li> This resource is out of sync with the local file system
	 *      and <code>force</code> is <code>false</code>.</li>
	 * <li> Resource changes are disallowed during certain types of resource change 
	 *       event notification. See <code>IResourceChangeEvent</code> for more details.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * @exception OperationCanceledException if the operation is canceled. 
	 * Cancelation can occur even if no progress monitor is provided.
	 * @see IResource#delete(int,IProgressMonitor)
	 * @see IResourceRuleFactory#deleteRule(IResource)
