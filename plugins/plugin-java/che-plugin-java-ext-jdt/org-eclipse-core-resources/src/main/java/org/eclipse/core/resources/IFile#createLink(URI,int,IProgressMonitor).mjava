  /**
   * Creates a new file resource as a member of this handle's parent resource. The file's contents
   * will be located in the file specified by the given URI. The given URI must be either absolute,
   * or a relative URI whose first path segment is the name of a workspace path variable.
   *
   * <p>The <code>ALLOW_MISSING_LOCAL</code> update flag controls how this method deals with cases
   * where the file system file to be linked does not exist, or is relative to a workspace path
   * variable that is not defined. If <code>ALLOW_MISSING_LOCAL</code> is specified, the operation
   * will succeed even if the local file is missing, or the path is relative to an undefined
   * variable. If <code>ALLOW_MISSING_LOCAL</code> is not specified, the operation will fail in the
   * case where the file system file does not exist or the path is relative to an undefined
   * variable.
   *
   * <p>The {@link IResource#REPLACE} update flag controls how this method deals with cases where a
   * resource of the same name as the prospective link already exists. If {@link IResource#REPLACE}
   * is specified, then any existing resource with the same name is removed from the workspace to
   * make way for creation of the link. This does <b>not</b> cause the underlying file system
   * contents of that resource to be deleted. If {@link IResource#REPLACE} is not specified, this
   * method will fail if an existing resource exists of the same name.
   *
   * <p>The {@link IResource#HIDDEN} update flag indicates that this resource should immediately be
   * set as a hidden resource. Specifying this flag is equivalent to atomically calling {@link
   * IResource#setHidden(boolean)} with a value of <code>true</code> immediately after creating the
   * resource.
   *
   * <p>Update flags other than those listed above are ignored.
   *
   * <p>This method synchronizes this resource with the file system at the given location.
   *
   * <p>This method changes resources; these changes will be reported in a subsequent resource
   * change event, including an indication that the file has been added to its parent.
   *
   * <p>This method is long-running; progress and cancellation are provided by the given progress
   * monitor.
   *
   * @param location a file system URI where the file should be linked
   * @param updateFlags bit-wise or of update flag constants ({@link IResource#ALLOW_MISSING_LOCAL},
   *     {@link IResource#REPLACE} and {@link IResource#HIDDEN})
   * @param monitor a progress monitor, or <code>null</code> if progress reporting is not desired
   * @exception CoreException if this method fails. Reasons include:
   *     <ul>
   *       <li>This resource already exists in the workspace.
   *       <li>The workspace contains a resource of a different type at the same path as this
   *           resource.
   *       <li>The parent of this resource does not exist.
   *       <li>The parent of this resource is not an open project
   *       <li>The name of this resource is not valid (according to <code>IWorkspace.validateName
   *           </code>).
   *       <li>The corresponding location in the file system does not exist, or is relative to an
   *           undefined variable, and <code>ALLOW_MISSING_LOCAL</code> is not specified.
   *       <li>The corresponding location in the file system is occupied by a directory (as opposed
   *           to a file).
   *       <li>Resource changes are disallowed during certain types of resource change event
   *           notification. See <code>IResourceChangeEvent</code> for more details.
   *       <li>The team provider for the project which contains this folder does not permit linked
   *           resources.
   *       <li>This folder's project contains a nature which does not permit linked resources.
   *     </ul>
   *
   * @exception OperationCanceledException if the operation is canceled. Cancelation can occur even
   *     if no progress monitor is provided.
   * @see IResource#isLinked()
