  /**
   * Sets whether this resource subtree is a team private member of its parent container.
   *
   * <p>A <b>team private member</b> resource is a special file or folder created by a team provider
   * to hold team-provider-specific information. Resources marked as team private members are
   * invisible to most clients.
   *
   * <p>Newly-created resources are not team private members by default; rather, the team provider
   * must mark a resource explicitly using <code>setTeamPrivateMember(true)</code>. Team private
   * member marks are maintained in the in-memory resource tree, and are discarded when the
   * resources are deleted. Team private member marks are saved to disk when a project is closed, or
   * when the workspace is saved.
   *
   * <p>Projects and the workspace root are never considered team private members; attempts to mark
   * them as team private are ignored.
   *
   * <p>This operation does <b>not</b> result in a resource change event, and does not trigger
   * autobuilds.
   *
   * @param isTeamPrivate <code>true</code> if this resource is to be marked as team private, and
   *     <code>false</code> otherwise
   * @exception CoreException if this method fails. Reasons include:
   *     <ul>
   *       <li>This resource does not exist.
   *       <li>Resource changes are disallowed during certain types of resource change event
   *           notification. See <code>IResourceChangeEvent</code> for more details.
   *     </ul>
