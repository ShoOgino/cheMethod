   * Validates the given string as the name of a resource valid for one of the given types.
   *
   * <p>In addition to the basic restrictions on paths in general (see {@link
   * IPath#isValidSegment(String)}), a resource name must also not contain any characters or
   * substrings that are not valid on the file system on which workspace root is located. In
   * addition, the names "." and ".." are reserved due to their special meaning in file system
   * paths.
   *
   * <p>This validation check is done automatically as a resource is created (but not when the
   * resource handle is constructed); this means that any resource that exists can be safely assumed
   * to have a valid name and path. Note that the name of the workspace root resource is inherently
   * invalid.
   *
   * @param segment the name segment to be checked
   * @param typeMask bitwise-or of the resource type constants ( <code>FILE</code>,<code>FOLDER
   *     </code>,<code>PROJECT</code> or <code>ROOT</code>) indicating expected resource type(s)
   * @return a status object with code <code>IStatus.OK</code> if the given string is valid as a
   *     resource name, otherwise a status object indicating what is wrong with the string
   * @see IResource#PROJECT
   * @see IResource#FOLDER
   * @see IResource#FILE
   * @see IStatus#OK
