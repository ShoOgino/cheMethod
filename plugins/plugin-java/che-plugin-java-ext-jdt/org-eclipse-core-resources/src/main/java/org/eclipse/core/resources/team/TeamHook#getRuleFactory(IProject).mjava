	 * is changed by calling <code>setRuleFactory</code>.

	 * This method must not return <code>null</code>. If no special rules are required
	 * by the team hook for the given project, the value of the <code>defaultFactory</code>
	 * field should be returned.

	 * This default implementation always returns the value of the <code>defaultFactory</code>
	 * field. Subclasses may override and provide a subclass of <code>ResourceRuleFactory</code>.
