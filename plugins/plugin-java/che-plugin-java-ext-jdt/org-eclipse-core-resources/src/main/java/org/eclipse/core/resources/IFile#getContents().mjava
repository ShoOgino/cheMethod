	 * Returns an open input stream on the contents of this file.
	 * <p>
	 * This refinement of the corresponding {@link IStorage} method
	 * is a convenience method returning an open input stream.  It's equivalent to:
	 * <pre>
	 *   getContents(RefreshManager#PREF_LIGHTWEIGHT_AUTO_REFRESH);
	 * </pre>
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * If lightweight auto-refresh is not enabled this method will throw a CoreException
	 * when opening out-of-sync resources.
	 * </p>
	 * The client is responsible for closing the stream when finished.
	 *
	 * @return an input stream containing the contents of the file
	 * @exception CoreException if this method fails. Reasons include:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li> This resource does not exist.</li>
	 * <li> This resource is not local.</li>
	 * <li> The file-system resource is not a file.</li>
	 * <li> The workspace is not in sync with the corresponding location
	 *       in the local file system (and {@link ResourcesPlugin#PREF_LIGHTWEIGHT_AUTO_REFRESH} 
	 *       is disabled).</li>
	 * </ul>
