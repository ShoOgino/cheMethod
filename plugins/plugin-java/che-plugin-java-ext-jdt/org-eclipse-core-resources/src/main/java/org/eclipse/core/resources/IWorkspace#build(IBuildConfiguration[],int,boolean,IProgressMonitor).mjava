  /**
   * Build the build configurations specified in the passed in build configuration array.
   *
   * <p>Build order is determined by the workspace description and the project build configuration
   * reference graph.
   *
   * <p>If buildReferences is true, build configurations reachable through the build configuration
   * graph are built as part of this build invocation.
   *
   * <p>This method may change resources; these changes will be reported in a subsequent resource
   * change event.
   *
   * <p>This method is long-running; progress and cancellation are provided by the given progress
   * monitor.
   *
   * @param buildConfigs array of configurations to build
   * @param kind the kind of build being requested. Valid values are
   *     <ul>
   *       <li>{@link IncrementalProjectBuilder#FULL_BUILD}- indicates a full build.
   *       <li>{@link IncrementalProjectBuilder#INCREMENTAL_BUILD}- indicates a incremental build.
   *       <li>{@link IncrementalProjectBuilder#CLEAN_BUILD}- indicates a clean request. Clean does
   *           not actually build anything, but rather discards all problems and build states.
   *     </ul>
   *
   * @param buildReferences boolean indicating if references should be transitively built.
   * @param monitor a progress monitor, or <code>null</code> if progress reporting is not desired
   * @exception CoreException if the build fails. The status contained in the exception may be a
   *     generic {@link IResourceStatus#BUILD_FAILED} code, but it could also be any other status
   *     code; it might also be a {@link MultiStatus}.
   * @exception OperationCanceledException if the operation is canceled. Cancellation can occur even
   *     if no progress monitor is provided.
