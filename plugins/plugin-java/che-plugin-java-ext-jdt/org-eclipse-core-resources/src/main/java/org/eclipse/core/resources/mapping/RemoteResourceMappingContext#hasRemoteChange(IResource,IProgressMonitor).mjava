   * For two-way comparisons, return whether the contents of the corresponding remote differs from

   * this method will return <code>true</code> if the remote contents differ from the local
   * contents.
   *
   * <p>For three-way comparisons, return whether the contents of the corresponding remote differ
   * from the contents of the base. In other words, this method returns <code>true</code> if the
   * corresponding remote has changed since the last time the local resource was updated with the
   * remote contents.
   *
   * <p>For two-way comparisons, return <code>true</code> if the remote contents differ from the
   * local contents. In this case, this method is equivalent to {@link #hasLocalChange(IResource,
   * IProgressMonitor)}
   *
   * <p>This can be used by clients to determine if they need to fetch the remote contents in order
   * to determine if the resources that constitute the model element are different in the remote
   * location. If the local file exists and the remote file does not, or the remote file exists and
   * the local does not then the contents will be said to differ (i.e. <code>true</code> is
   * returned). Also, implementors will most likely use a timestamp based comparison to determine if
   * the contents differ. This may lead to a situation where <code>true</code> is returned but the
   * actual contents do not differ. Clients must be prepared handle this situation.
   *
   * @param resource the local resource
   * @param monitor a progress monitor, or <code>null</code> if progress reporting is not desired

   * @exception CoreException if the contents could not be compared. Reasons include:
   *     <ul>
   *       <li>The server could not be contacted for some reason.
   *       <li>The corresponding remote resource is not a container (status code will be {@link
   *           IResourceStatus#RESOURCE_WRONG_TYPE}).
