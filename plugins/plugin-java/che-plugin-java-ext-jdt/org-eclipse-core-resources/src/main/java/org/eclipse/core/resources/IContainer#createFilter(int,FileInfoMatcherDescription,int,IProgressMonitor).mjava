	 * changes to the resource hierarchy under this container resulting from the new
	 * filter take effect. If this flag is specified, the resource hierarchy is updated in a 
	 * separate thread after this method returns. If the flag is not specified, any resource 
	 * changes resulting from the new filter  will occur before this method returns.
	 * </p>
	 * <p> 
	 * This operation changes resources; these changes will be reported
	 * in a subsequent resource change event that will include an indication of any 
	 * resources that have been removed as a result of the new filter.
