	/**
	 * Creates a new project resource in the workspace using the given project
	 * description. Upon successful completion, the project will exist but be closed.
	 * <p>
	 * Newly created projects have no session or persistent properties. 
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * If the project content area given in the project description does not 
	 * contain a project description file, a project description file is written
	 * in the project content area with the natures, build spec, comment, and 
	 * referenced projects as specified in the given project description.
	 * If there is an existing project description file, it is not overwritten.
	 * In either case, this method does <b>not</b> cause natures to be configured.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * This method changes resources; these changes will be reported
	 * in a subsequent resource change event, including an indication 
	 * that the project has been added to the workspace.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * This method is long-running; progress and cancellation are provided
	 * by the given progress monitor. 
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The {@link IResource#HIDDEN} update flag indicates that this resource
	 * should immediately be set as a hidden resource.  Specifying this flag
	 * is equivalent to atomically calling {@link IResource#setHidden(boolean)}
	 * with a value of <code>true</code> immediately after creating the resource.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Update flags other than those listed above are ignored.
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * @param description the project description
	 * @param monitor a progress monitor, or <code>null</code> if progress
	 *    reporting is not desired
	 * @exception CoreException if this method fails. Reasons include:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li> This project already exists in the workspace.</li>
	 * <li> The name of this resource is not valid (according to 
	 *    <code>IWorkspace.validateName</code>).</li>
	 * <li> The project location is not valid (according to
	 *      <code>IWorkspace.validateProjectLocation</code>).</li>
	 * <li> The project description file could not be created in the project 
	 *      content area.</li>
	 * <li> Resource changes are disallowed during certain types of resource change 
	 *       event notification. See <code>IResourceChangeEvent</code> for more details.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * @exception OperationCanceledException if the operation is canceled. 
	 * Cancelation can occur even if no progress monitor is provided.
	 *
	 * @see IWorkspace#validateProjectLocation(IProject, IPath)
