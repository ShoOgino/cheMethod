	 * This method changes resources; these changes will be reported
	 * in a subsequent resource change event that includes
	 * an indication that the project has been opened and its resources
	 * have been added to the tree.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * This method is long-running; progress and cancellation are provided
	 * by the given progress monitor.
	 * </p>
	 *

	 *    reporting is not desired
	 * @exception CoreException if this method fails. Reasons include:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li> Resource changes are disallowed during certain types of resource change 
	 *       event notification. See <code>IResourceChangeEvent</code> for more details.</li>
	 * </ul>
