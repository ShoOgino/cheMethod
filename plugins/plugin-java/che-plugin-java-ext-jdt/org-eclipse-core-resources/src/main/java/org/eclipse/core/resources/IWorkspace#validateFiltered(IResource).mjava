	 * Validates that the given resource will not (or would not, if the resource
	 * doesn't exist in the workspace yet) be filtered out from the workspace by
	 * its parent resource filters.
	 * <p>
	 * Note that if the resource or its parent doesn't exist yet in the workspace, 
	 * it is possible that it will still be effectively filtered out once the resource
	 * and/or its parent is created, even though this method doesn't report it.
	 * 
	 * But if this method reports the resource as filtered, even though it, or its 
	 * parent, doesn't exist in the workspace yet, it means that the resource will
	 * be filtered out by its parent resource filters once it exists in the workspace.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * This method will return a status with severity <code>IStatus.ERROR</code>
	 * if the resource will be filtered out - removed - out of the workspace by 
	 * its parent resource filters. 
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Note: linked resources and virtual folders are never filtered out by their
	 * parent resource filters.
