  /**
   * Accepts the given visitor. The visitor's <code>visit</code> method is called with this
   * resource. If the visitor returns <code>false</code>, this resource's members are not visited.
   *
   * <p>The subtree under the given resource is traversed to the supplied depth.
   *
   * <p>No guarantees are made about the behavior of this method if resources are deleted or added
   * during the traversal of this resource hierarchy. If resources are deleted during the traversal,
   * they may still be passed to the visitor; if resources are created, they may not be passed to
   * the visitor.
   *
   * <p>If the {@link IContainer#INCLUDE_PHANTOMS} flag is not specified in the member flags
   * (recommended), only member resources that exists are visited. If the {@link
   * IContainer#INCLUDE_PHANTOMS} flag is specified, the visit also includes any phantom member
   * resource that the workspace is keeping track of.
   *
   * <p>If the {@link IContainer#INCLUDE_TEAM_PRIVATE_MEMBERS} flag is not specified (recommended),
   * team private members are not visited. If the {@link IContainer#INCLUDE_TEAM_PRIVATE_MEMBERS}
   * flag is specified in the member flags, team private member resources are visited as well.
   *
   * <p>If the {@link IContainer#EXCLUDE_DERIVED} flag is not specified (recommended), derived
   * resources are visited. If the {@link IContainer#EXCLUDE_DERIVED} flag is specified in the
   * member flags, derived resources are not visited.
   *
   * <p>If the {@link IContainer#INCLUDE_HIDDEN} flag is not specified (recommended), hidden
   * resources will not be visited. If the {@link IContainer#INCLUDE_HIDDEN} flag is specified in
   * the member flags, hidden resources are visited as well.
   *
   * <p>If the {@link IContainer#DO_NOT_CHECK_EXISTENCE} flag is not specified (recommended), the
   * resource is checked for existence before the visitor's <code>visit</code> method is called. If
   * the {@link IContainer#DO_NOT_CHECK_EXISTENCE} flag is specified in the member flags, the
   * resource is not checked for existence before the visitor's <code>visit</code> method is called.
   * Children of the resource are never checked for existence.
   *
   * @param visitor the visitor
   * @param depth the depth to which members of this resource should be visited. One of {@link
   *     IResource#DEPTH_ZERO}, {@link IResource#DEPTH_ONE}, or {@link IResource#DEPTH_INFINITE}.
   * @param memberFlags bit-wise or of member flag constants ({@link IContainer#INCLUDE_PHANTOMS},
   *     {@link IContainer#INCLUDE_TEAM_PRIVATE_MEMBERS}, {@link IContainer#INCLUDE_HIDDEN} and
   *     {@link IContainer#EXCLUDE_DERIVED}) indicating which members are of interest and {@link
   *     IContainer#DO_NOT_CHECK_EXISTENCE} if the resource on which the method is called should not
   *     be checked for existence
   * @exception CoreException if this request fails. Reasons include:
   *     <ul>
   *       <li>the {@link IContainer#INCLUDE_PHANTOMS} flag is not specified and this resource does
   *           not exist.
   *       <li>the {@link IContainer#INCLUDE_PHANTOMS} flag is not specified and this resource is a
   *           project that is not open.
   *       <li>the {@link IContainer#DO_NOT_CHECK_EXISTENCE} flag is not specified and this resource
   *           does not exist.
   *       <li>The visitor failed with this exception.
