	/**
	 * Accepts the given visitor for an optimized traversal. 
	 * The visitor's <code>visit</code> method is called, and is provided with a
	 * proxy to this resource.  The proxy is a transient object that can be queried
	 * very quickly for information about the resource. If the actual resource
	 * handle is needed, it can be obtained from the proxy. Requesting the resource
	 * handle, or the full path of the resource, will degrade performance of the
	 * visit.
	 * <p>
	 * The entire subtree under the given resource is traversed to the supplied depth,
	 * unless the visitor ignores a subtree by returning <code>false</code> from its
	 * <code>visit</code> method.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>No  guarantees are made about the behavior of this method if resources
	 * are deleted or added during the traversal of this resource hierarchy.  If
	 * resources are deleted during the traversal, they may still be passed to the
	 * visitor; if resources are created, they may not be passed to the visitor.  If
	 * resources other than the one being visited are modified during the traversal,
	 * the resource proxy may contain stale information when that resource is
	 * visited.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * If the {@link IContainer#INCLUDE_PHANTOMS} flag is not specified in the member 
	 * flags (recommended), only member resources that exist will be visited.
	 * If the {@link IContainer#INCLUDE_PHANTOMS} flag is specified, the visit will
	 * also include any phantom member resource that the workspace is keeping track of.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * If the {@link IContainer#INCLUDE_TEAM_PRIVATE_MEMBERS} flag is not specified
	 * (recommended), team private members will not be visited. If the 
	 * {@link IContainer#INCLUDE_TEAM_PRIVATE_MEMBERS} flag is specified in the member
	 * flags, team private member resources are visited as well.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * If the {@link IContainer#INCLUDE_HIDDEN} flag is not specified (recommended), 
	 * hidden resources will not be visited. If the {@link IContainer#INCLUDE_HIDDEN} flag is specified 
	 * in the member flags, hidden resources are visited as well.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * If the {@link IContainer#DO_NOT_CHECK_EXISTENCE} flag is not specified (recommended), 
	 * the resource is checked for existence before the visitor's <code>visit</code>
	 * method is called. If the {@link IContainer#DO_NOT_CHECK_EXISTENCE} flag is specified
	 * in the member flags, the resource is not checked for existence before the visitor's
	 * <code>visit</code> method is called. Children of the resource are never checked
	 * for existence.
	 * </p>

	 * @param depth the depth to which members of this resource should be
