	/**
	 * Copies the given sibling resources so that they are located as members of
	 * the resource at the given path; the names of the copies are the same as
	 * the corresponding originals.
	 * <p>
	 * This method can be expressed as a series of calls to
	 * <code>IResource.copy(IPath,int,IProgressMonitor)</code>, with "best
	 * effort" semantics:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>Resources are copied in the order specified, using the given update
	 * flags.</li>
	 * <li>Duplicate resources are only copied once.</li>
	 * <li>The method fails if the resources are not all siblings.</li>
	 * <li>The failure of an individual copy does not necessarily prevent the
	 * method from attempting to copy other resources.</li>
	 * <li>The method fails if there are projects among the resources.</li>
	 * <li>The method fails if the path of the resources is a prefix of the
	 * destination path.</li>
	 * <li>This method also fails if one or more of the individual resource
	 * copy steps fails.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * After successful completion, corresponding new resources will now exist
	 * as members of the resource at the given path.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The supplied path may be absolute or relative. Absolute paths fully
	 * specify the new location for the resource, including its project.
	 * Relative paths are considered to be relative to the container of the
	 * resources being copied. A trailing separator is ignored.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * This method changes resources; these changes will be reported in a
	 * subsequent resource change event that will include an indication that the
	 * resources have been added to the new parent.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * This method is long-running; progress and cancellation are provided by
	 * the given progress monitor.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * @param resources the resources to copy
	 * @param destination the destination container path
	 * @param updateFlags bit-wise or of update flag constants
	 * @param monitor a progress monitor, or <code>null</code> if progress
	 * reporting is not desired
	 * @return a status object with code <code>OK</code> if there were no
	 * problems; otherwise a description (possibly a multi-status) consisting of
	 * low-severity warnings or informational messages
	 * @exception CoreException if the method fails to copy some resources. The
	 * status contained in the exception may be a multi-status indicating where
	 * the individual failures occurred. Reasons include:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>One of the resources does not exist.</li>
	 * <li>The resources are not siblings.</li>
	 * <li>One of the resources, or one of its descendents, is not local.</li>
	 * <li>The resource corresponding to the destination path does not exist.
	 * </li>
	 * <li>The resource corresponding to the parent destination path is a
	 * closed project.</li>
	 * <li>A corresponding target resource does exist.</li>
	 * <li>A resource of a different type exists at the target path.</li>
	 * <li>One of the resources is a project.</li>
	 * <li>The path of one of the resources is a prefix of the destination
	 * path.</li>
	 * <li>One of the resources, or one of its descendents, is out of sync with
	 * the local file system and <code>FORCE</code> is not specified.</li>
	 * <li>Resource changes are disallowed during certain types of resource
	 * change event notification. See <code>IResourceChangeEvent</code> for
	 * more details.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * @exception OperationCanceledException if the operation is canceled. 
	 * Cancelation can occur even if no progress monitor is provided.
	 * @see IResource#copy(IPath,int,IProgressMonitor)
	 * @see IResourceRuleFactory#copyRule(IResource, IResource)
