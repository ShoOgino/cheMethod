	 * Sets the build configurations referenced by the specified configuration.
	 * <p>
	 * The configuration to which references are being added needs to exist in this
	 * description, but the referenced projects and build configurations need not exist.
	 * A reference with <code>null</code> configuration name is resolved to the active build configuration
	 * on use.
	 * Duplicates will be removed. The order of the referenced build configurations is preserved.
	 * If the given configuration does not exist in this description then this has no effect.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * References at the build configuration level take precedence over references at the project level.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Like dynamic references, these build configuration references are persisted as part of workspace
	 * metadata.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Users must call {@link IProject#setDescription(IProjectDescription, int, IProgressMonitor)}
	 * before changes made to this description take effect.
	 * </p>

	 * @see #getBuildConfigReferences(String)

	 * @param configName the configuration in the described project to set the references for
	 * @param references list of build configuration references
