	/**
	 * Validates the given path as the location of the given project on disk.
	 * The path must be either an absolute file system path, or a relative path
	 * whose first segment is the name of a defined workspace path variable. In
	 * addition to the restrictions for paths in general (see <code>IPath.
	 * isValidPath</code>),
	 * a location path should also obey the following rules:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>must not be the same as another open or closed project</li>
	 * <li>must not occupy the default location for any project, whether existing or not</li>
	 * <li>must not be the same as or a parent of the platform's working directory</li>
	 * <li>must not be the same as or a child of the location of any existing
	 * linked resource in the given project</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Note: this method does not consider whether files or directories exist in
	 * the file system at the specified path.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * @param project the project to validate the location for, can be <code>null</code>
	 * if non default project location is validated
	 * @param location the location of the project contents on disk, or <code>null</code> 
	 * if the default project location is used
	 * @return a status object with code <code>IStatus.OK</code> if the given
	 * location is valid as the project content location, otherwise a status
	 * object indicating what is wrong with the location
	 * @see IProjectDescription#getLocationURI()
	 * @see IProjectDescription#setLocation(IPath)
