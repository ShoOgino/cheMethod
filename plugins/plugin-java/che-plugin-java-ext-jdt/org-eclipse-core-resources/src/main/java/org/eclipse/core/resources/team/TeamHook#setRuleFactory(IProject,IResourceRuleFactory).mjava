	 * since the initial call to <code>getRuleFactory</code> for the given project
	 * <p>
	 * The supplied factory must not be <code>null</code>. If no special rules are required
	 * by the team hook for the given project, the value of the <code>defaultFactory</code>
	 * field should be used.
	 * <p>
	 * Note that the new rule factory will only take effect for resource changing
	 * operations that begin after this method completes. Care should be taken to
	 * avoid calling this method during the invocation of any resource changing
	 * operation (in any thread). The best time to change rule factories is during resource
	 * change notification when the workspace is locked for modification.
