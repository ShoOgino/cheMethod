	 * If this resource is a project that exists in the workspace, this method
	 * returns the URI to the project's local content area. This is true regardless
	 * of whether the project is open or closed. This value will be null in the case
	 * where the location is relative to an undefined workspace path variable.

	 * If this resource is a linked resource under a project that is open, this
	 * method returns the resolved URI to the linked resource's local contents.
	 * This value will be null in the case where the location is relative to an
	 * undefined workspace path variable.
	 * </p><p>
	 * If this resource is a file or folder under a project that exists, or a
	 * linked resource under a closed project, this method returns a (non-
	 * <code>null</code>) URI computed from the location of the project's local
	 * content area and the project- relative path of the file or folder. This is
	 * true regardless of whether the file or folders exists, or whether the project
	 * is open or closed. In the case of linked resources, the location of a linked resource
	 * within a closed project is computed from the location of the
	 * project's local content area and the project-relative path of the resource. If the
	 * linked resource resides in an open project then its location is computed
	 * according to the link.

	 * If this resource is a project that does not exist in the workspace,
	 * or a file or folder below such a project, this method returns
