  /**
   * Returns the dynamic project references for the described project. Dynamic project references
   * can be used instead of simple project references in cases where the reference information is
   * computed dynamically be a third party. These references are persisted by the workspace in a
   * private location outside the project description file, and as such will not be shared when a
   * project is exported or persisted in a repository. A client using project references is always
   * responsible for setting these references when a project is created or recreated.
   *
   * <p>The returned projects need not exist in the workspace. The result will not contain
   * duplicates. Returns an empty array if there are no dynamic project references on this
   * description.
