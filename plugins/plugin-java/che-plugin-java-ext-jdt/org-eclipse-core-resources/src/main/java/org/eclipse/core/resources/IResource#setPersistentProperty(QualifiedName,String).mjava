   * <p>Persistent properties are intended to be used by plug-ins to store resource-specific
   * information that should be persisted across platform sessions. The value of a persistent
   * property is a string that must be short - 2KB or less in length. Unlike session properties,
   * persistent properties are stored on disk and maintained across workspace shutdown and restart.
   *
   * <p>The qualifier part of the property name must be the unique identifier of the declaring
   * plug-in (e.g. <code>"com.example.plugin"</code>).
   *
   * @param key the qualified name of the property
   * @param value the string value of the property, or <code>null</code> if the property is to be
   *     removed
   * @exception CoreException if this method fails. Reasons include:
   *     <ul>
   *       <li>This resource does not exist.
   *       <li>This resource is not local.
   *       <li>This resource is a project that is not open.
   *       <li>Resource changes are disallowed during certain types of resource change event
   *           notification. See <code>IResourceChangeEvent</code> for more details.
