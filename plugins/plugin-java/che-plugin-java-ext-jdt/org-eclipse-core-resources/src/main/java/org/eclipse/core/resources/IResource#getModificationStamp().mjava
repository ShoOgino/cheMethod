  /**
   * Returns a non-negative modification stamp, or <code>NULL_STAMP</code> if the resource does not
   * exist or is not local or is not accessible.
   *
   * <p>A resource's modification stamp gets updated each time a resource is modified. If a
   * resource's modification stamp is the same, the resource has not changed. Conversely, if a
   * resource's modification stamp is different, some aspect of it (other than properties) has been
   * modified at least once (possibly several times). Resource modification stamps are preserved
   * across project close/re-open, and across workspace shutdown/restart. The magnitude or sign of
   * the numerical difference between two modification stamps is not significant.
   *
   * <p>The following things affect a resource's modification stamp:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>creating a non-project resource (changes from <code>NULL_STAMP</code>)
   *   <li>changing the contents of a file
   *   <li><code>touch</code>ing a resource
   *   <li>setting the attributes of a project presented in a project description
   *   <li>deleting a resource (changes to <code>NULL_STAMP</code>)
   *   <li>moving a resource (source changes to <code>NULL_STAMP</code>, destination changes from
   *       <code>NULL_STAMP</code>)
   *   <li>copying a resource (destination changes from <code>NULL_STAMP</code>)
   *   <li>making a resource local
   *   <li>closing a project (changes to <code>NULL_STAMP</code>)
   *   <li>opening a project (changes from <code>NULL_STAMP</code>)
   *   <li>adding or removing a project nature (changes from <code>NULL_STAMP</code>)
   * </ul>
   *
   * The following things do not affect a resource's modification stamp:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>"reading" a resource
   *   <li>adding or removing a member of a project or folder
   *   <li>setting a session property
   *   <li>setting a persistent property
   *   <li>saving the workspace
   *   <li>shutting down and re-opening a workspace
   * </ul>
   *
   * @return the modification stamp, or <code>NULL_STAMP</code> if this resource either does not
   *     exist or exists as a closed project
   * @see IResource#NULL_STAMP
