	/**
	 * Returns a non-negative modification stamp, or <code>NULL_STAMP</code> if 
	 * the resource does not exist or is not local or is not accessible.
	 * <p>
	 * A resource's modification stamp gets updated each time a resource is modified.
	 * If a resource's modification stamp is the same, the resource has not changed.
	 * Conversely, if a resource's modification stamp is different, some aspect of it
	 * (other than properties) has been modified at least once (possibly several times).
	 * Resource modification stamps are preserved across project close/re-open,
	 * and across workspace shutdown/restart.
	 * The magnitude or sign of the numerical difference between two modification stamps 
	 * is not significant.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The following things affect a resource's modification stamp:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>creating a non-project resource (changes from <code>NULL_STAMP</code>)</li>
	 * <li>changing the contents of a file</li>
	 * <li><code>touch</code>ing a resource</li>
	 * <li>setting the attributes of a project presented in a project description</li>
	 * <li>deleting a resource (changes to <code>NULL_STAMP</code>)</li>
	 * <li>moving a resource (source changes to <code>NULL_STAMP</code>,
	 destination changes from <code>NULL_STAMP</code>)</li>
	 * <li>copying a resource (destination changes from <code>NULL_STAMP</code>)</li>
	 * <li>making a resource local</li>
	 * <li>closing a project (changes to <code>NULL_STAMP</code>)</li>
	 * <li>opening a project (changes from <code>NULL_STAMP</code>)</li>
	 * <li>adding or removing a project nature (changes from <code>NULL_STAMP</code>)</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * The following things do not affect a resource's modification stamp:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>"reading" a resource</li>
	 * <li>adding or removing a member of a project or folder</li>
	 * <li>setting a session property</li>
	 * <li>setting a persistent property</li>
	 * <li>saving the workspace</li>
	 * <li>shutting down and re-opening a workspace</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * @return the modification stamp, or <code>NULL_STAMP</code> if this resource either does
	 *    not exist or exists as a closed project
