   * Sets the file name patterns to use during qualified name updating.
   *
   * <p>The syntax of the file name patterns is a sequence of individual name patterns, separated by
   * comma. Additionally, wildcard characters '*' (any string) and '?' (any character) may be used.
   *
   * <p>Note: If file name patterns are set, qualified name updating must be enabled by calling
   * {@link #setUpdateQualifiedNames(boolean)}.
   *
   * <p>Note: Qualified name updating is currently applicable to the Java elements {@link
   * IPackageFragment} and {@link IType}. The default is to use no file name patterns (meaning that
   * all files are processed).
   *
