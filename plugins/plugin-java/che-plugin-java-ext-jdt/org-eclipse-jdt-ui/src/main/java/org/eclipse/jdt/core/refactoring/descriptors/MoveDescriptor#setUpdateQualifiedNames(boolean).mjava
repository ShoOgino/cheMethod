   * non-Java text files. Clients may specify file name patterns by calling {@link
   * #setFileNamePatterns(String)} to constrain the set of text files to be processed.
   *
   * <p>Note: Qualified name updating is currently applicable to files, folders and compilation
   * units. The default is to use no file name patterns (meaning that all files are processed).
   *
   * @param update <code>true</code> to update qualified names, <code>false</code> otherwise
