     * copies of referenced object to fulfill this requirement.
     * <p/>
     * Implementers of this method should use the copy constructor <code>
     * Edit#Edit(Edit source) to initialize the edit part of the copy.
     * Implementors aren't responsible to actually copy the children or
     * to set the right parent.
     * <p/>
     * This method <b>should not be called</b> from outside the framework.
